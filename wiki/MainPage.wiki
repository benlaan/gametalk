= Introduction =

The Laan.GameLibrary (LGL) is an attempt to build a distributed object architecture for gaming.  It employs 2 way blocking socket communication between client and server using Indy (Internet Direct) component library.


= Details =

The parts that compose the LGL are:

* Socket Architecture

  Employing two way blocking sockets, messages can be sent between the client and server from either direction, without the use of polling.

* Entity Framework

  All entities that can be distributed across the network must use this framework, consisting of either a contained server or client communication class.

  Using the CodeSmith code generation technique, new entities and the entire 'plumbing' infrastructure are built automatically.

* Game Arena / Lobby

  Although still a work in progress, the Lobby allows finding, joining and commencing games using the predefined classes, simplying requiring subclassing for any necessary custom additions.
