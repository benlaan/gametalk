{TODO :
Build a new list base class that provides quicker finding by ID - perhaps
use a hashtable based on the ID.}
{TODO : 
Class properties need to have setters/getters that are Integer based
which will be used to find the item within the datastore}
{DONE : 
Introduce BaseServer and BaseClient classes.  These classes should 
contain the Server and Client Communications classes.  Remove the creation
from the inherited classes}
